# Email Spam Detection System

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a robust email spam detection system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the content and characteristics of emails, the system aims to accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate. To achieve this, we have used the "spam.csv" dataset.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name:** spam.csv
- **Description:** The dataset contains a collection of labeled emails, with each email marked as either "spam" or "legitimate." It includes the text content of the emails, which serves as the primary data for our analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`spam.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing.
- **`email_spam_detection.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We start by cleaning and processing the email text data, which includes tasks like removing HTML tags, handling special characters, and converting text to a suitable format for analysis.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from the email text. Common features include word frequencies, character frequencies, and various text statistics.

3. **Model Selection**: We experiment with different machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and deep learning models, to find the best-performing model for spam classification.

4. **Model Training**: The selected model is trained on the preprocessed email data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC on a testing dataset.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning of the model's hyperparameters is performed to optimize performance.

7. **Deployment (Optional)**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can consider deploying it as a service or integrating it into your email client to automatically classify incoming emails.

## Usage

To reproduce or build upon this project:

1. Download the "spam.csv" dataset or use a similar labeled email dataset.
2. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter Notebook (`email_spam_detection.ipynb`) to your local environment.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook, adapting it to your dataset as needed.

Feel free to experiment with different models, feature engineering techniques, and preprocessing steps to further enhance the email spam detection system.
